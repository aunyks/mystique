Create a identities in a cinch!

### What?
Mystique is a JavaScript library that enables rapid creation of new cryptographic keypairs: just one line lets you generate an entirely new online identity. At this point in time, Mystique enables creation of PGP, Bitcoin, and Ethereum keys, and more will be available in the future!  

### Why?
In many cases, your online identity is the collection of your cryptographic keypairs: PGP, Bitcoin, SSH, etc. Therefore, to quickly create new identities, you must quickly create new keypairs. The ability to do so boosts OPSEC capabilities, as it lets individuals be more agile in retaining or changing their identity on the Internet. This could be of great use when maintaining anonymity or evading a motivated threat.  

### How?
Docs coming soon! For now, take a look at the (small and readable) codebase to see how things work.
