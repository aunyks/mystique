# mystique
Create new identities in a cinch!

## How?
To use mystique in your project, execute the following line in your terminal!
```
npm i -S mystique-lib
```

## What?
Mystique is a JavaScript library that enables rapid creation of new cryptographic keypairs: just one line lets you generate an entirely new online identity. At this point in time, Mystique enables creation of PGP, Bitcoin, and Ethereum keys, and more will be available in the future!  

## Why?
In many cases, your online identity is the collection of your cryptographic keypairs: PGP, Bitcoin, SSH, etc. Therefore, to quickly create new identities, you must quickly create new keypairs. The ability to do so boosts OPSEC capabilities, as it lets individuals be more agile in retaining or changing their identity on the Internet. This could be of great use when maintaining anonymity or evading a motivated threat.  

**Why PGP?**  
PGP is one of the most reputable cryptographic identity solutions to exist today. It allows for encryption/decryption of messages alongside signature and verification, and it's longstanding and has a multitude of clients that support its functionality. I chose PGP to serve as the communication component of an identity.  

**Why Bitcoin?**  
Bitcoin is the longest standing secure, decentralized cryptocurrency to exist. And, its monetary policy renders it an excellent choice for wealth storage and transfer. I intend this to be a Gold reserve for your identity, as it could be used to store value for extended periods of time with low technological risk of loss.  

**Why Ethereum?**
Ethereum is the most popular expressive decentralized cryptocurrency to exist. The ability for users and developers to provide new functionality to money renders it an excellent choice for moving, changing, and otherwise managing value through its more expressive smart contracts and protocols. I intend Ethereum to be used for day-to-day management of online value, as opposed to Bitcoin's long term storage, although the two's uses are up to the user.  

## How?
Docs coming soon! For now, take a look at the (small and readable) codebase to see how things work.
